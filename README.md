Some information for residents


<< There's a problem with residents being responsible for this - they have to be motivated by the campaign.  Even if we don;t do them all, getting a lot of them will help.  Boiler water loss contributes to boiler wear and tear majorly, according to Gordon.  He's started me on my upper division boiler courses this semester.

## Help save TA energy and money
### Extend your radiator shut off valves life
### while being more comfortable!### Help make extend our boiler life at the same time!!!
### Regulator ValvesOld rocket nose cone regulator  &  Replacement new regulator side by side pics, with names & URLs in captions, current web price).

Point out possible plaster damp near valve (leaks happen at the top - detectable with a finger held just above it when steam's up)
### How many of these do you have?

#### Hoffman #1A ____   Vent Rite #1_____
 (I can't see many residents doing this.  We could arrange a single plumber visit with cost sharing)
#### Replacing these is best done when the heat isn't running (for safety's sake):   - Close the radiator's shut off valve - Remove its cover if it has one - Unscrew the old valve - Screw in the new one (use pipe thread compound, or teflon tape, but keep it away from the opening) - If necessary, get a hole cut in the cover so you can turn the steam control dial in the regulator - Replace the radiator cover - Re-open the shutoff valve 

### Be kind to your shut off valve
Using the shut off valve frequently wears it out.  It also loses water and steam if the packing nut comes loose.This is easily fixed in minutes!
