Technical information for residents, gleaned from the master plumber from our boiler servicing company.  All errors are mine.  I am not a plumber or a licensed heating person.   

### Water loss is a key factor in shortening boiler life.
### Our boiler lost 2,000 gallons in the 2019-2020 season.


If your radiator makes tinkling noises it might be spitting water.  Hissing could mean you have a steam leak.  


Extend shut-off valve life, control your heat better, and save on repairs.  Help extend our boiler life, saving us money in the long run


### How? Two ways...

### 1: Replace nose-cone style air venting valve with Vent Rite #1
![Valves](RadiatorValvesTxt.jpg)

[Plumbing and Heating Warehouse](https://www.phwarehouse.com/) sold me some Vent Rite #1's at $27 apiece plus shipping.  
	
Steam and water leaks can damage nearby plaster and wood.  
	*-Hold a finger above the vent valve when steam's up to detect a leak.  
	-Put a dry paper towel under the vent valve and the shutoff valve to detect drips.*

I replaced mine when the heat wasn't running, on a warm day (for safety's sake).  A plumber might be brave enough to do this at other times.  Instructions are on the inside of the Vent-Rite box, if you are feeling a bit DIY (no explicit or implied guarantees from me, though!).   

My Vent-Rite #1 reduces the radiator heat a lot when it's white setting dial is turned down all the way (turn gently, lowering numbers, till it stops.  It might overshoot the "1" slightly, and look like it's at 8 or 7 before it stops).  If it's fully open (8) it might spit and hiss.  I lowered the dial until it stopped hissing, at around 3 or 4).


### 2: Be kind to your shut-off valve
Using the shut-off valve frequently wears it out.  In addition, it is only meant to be either completely off or fully open (backed off 1/2 a turn from the hard open stop).  It can spit water and steam if the packing nut works loose.  Does it rattle when you open or close it?  It shouldn't.  Get its packing nut tightened.  I tightened one packing nut, but got nervous at how much torque I had to apply.  I did reduce the leak some.  The master plumber tightened it considerably more, stopping the leak.  He knows what he's doing.

**A concluding comment: clanking and banging are not part of normal steam heat operations, but it takes iterated summer maintenance/repair sessions to reduce or eliminate these.**
